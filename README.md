# compare.js

compare.js implements JavaScript's comparison operators for Node.js and the browser the way you would expect them to be.

## Installation

    $ TBD

## Features

## Quick Start

Using compare.js is easy. All you need to do is to add a reference to it within your Node.js application:

```javascript
var cmp = require('compare.js');
```

Now you are able to use the various comparison operators:

    cmp.eq() => equal
    cmp.ne() => not equal
    cmp.gt() => greater than
    cmp.ge() => greater than or equal
    cmp.lt() => less than
    cmp.le() => less than or equal
    cmp.id() => identical

That's it :-)!
